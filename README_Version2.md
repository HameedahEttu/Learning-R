# Personal Learning Journey

Welcome! This project is designed as a dedicated space for me to explore, experiment, and deepen my understanding of new concepts, tools, and technologies in R. The focus here is on my growth and self-directed learning.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning process as I work through R. It serves as a sandbox for trying out code, taking notes, and reflecting on what I’ve learned. This is not intended as a polished resource for others, but rather as a living record of my progress and understanding.

## How I Use This Repository

- **Experimentation:** I freely test out new code snippets, frameworks, libraries, and ideas here—even if they’re messy or incomplete.
- **Documentation:** I jot down notes, explanations, and reflections to help reinforce my understanding and track what I’ve learned.
- **Practice:** I work through exercises, challenges, or tutorials, and may revisit topics to deepen my mastery.
- **Iteration:** The content may evolve as I learn more, correct misunderstandings, or decide to try different approaches.

## Structure

The organization of this repository may change over time to best match my learning needs. You may find:

- Topic-based folders (e.g., `algorithms/`, `web-dev/`)
- Notes and markdown files summarizing concepts or solutions
- Code experiments, scratch files, or project prototypes

## Disclaimer

This repository is a personal workspace. Code or notes may be incomplete, experimental, or contain errors as I learn. The content is not optimized for public consumption or reuse.

## Why Document My Learning?

- Writing and coding as I learn helps solidify my understanding.
- Having a record allows me to see my growth and revisit past lessons.
- Reflecting on challenges and solutions guides me toward deeper mastery.

If you happen to stumble upon this and find something useful, that’s great! However, please keep in mind the primary audience is myself as a learner.

Happy learning!
